##Code Review: Benny  

Today’s lab: if statement inside event handler  
constructor (creating objects inside an array), listening, event, if statements  

## Wireframe Review  
placeholder.it/10x10/000000  
inline-block vs. inline  
border-collaps: collapse;  
border-spacing; 15px;  
take an example that’s already been created (professional sites), use, sample, and review, and adjust  
overflow: auto (must set height)  
border-radius: 3px;  
cursor: pointer;  <— converts cursor to pointer when hovered over.  
button:hover {background: green};  
transition: 350ms all;  
clear: both; <— clears previous section’s floats

## Lab
Products: 
- 3 at a time, side by side (same size)  
store what they clicked, calculate, display results (after 25 selections made)  
- custom font, color palette, layout with semantic html  
- we write own user story:  
- mkt team needs to know click data  
- dev needs ?: constructor, array, for  
- end-user needs:  
- DO FIRST: user_stories.md, 30-45 mins to write  
- When coding: display 1 image, to start  
- build in logic, can’t have duplicate images in subsequent rounds  
- event listener // remove event listener  
- event listener (adds “view results now" button)  
- renders list of all products: # of votes for each  
- No chart (tues)    
- No persistence over page refresh (wed)  
- Inspect your array of objects and make sure vote has taken place  
- use console logs to see vote totals  
- conceptualize and sketch  
- track how many times a pic has been shown  
- attach event listener to outer container of 3 images  
- one event handler, too 	 
- event listener will tell you which image got clicked within container  
- if no image clicked (but container clicked), alert says click on an image
