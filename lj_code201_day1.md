# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today was a lot about setup and procedures, including some of the aspects I had learned in 101 and 102. But luckily, it went beyond. Sam explained Model View Controller (MVC) for the request-response cycle between client-server-data store. We covered a ton of Unix Commands: ls, mkdir, mv, pwd, cd, clear, quit, cp, rm, history, date/cal, rmdir, and touch. Though I had initially done the gist commands in 101, we had a needed refresher on Git: git clone url, git add --all, git status, git commit -m “msg”, git push origin master. How to use the javascript console in Chrome, and why to use console log in your code to help with debugging was super helpful. Lastly, it was great to hear about single-quotes for javascript and double-quotes for HTML.

There are a lot of people in our class, so I can imagine it'll be tough for Sam and the TA's to cover everyone.
